# Attested OHTTP Server

This repository is an implementation of an attested OHTTP server for [Azure AI Confidential Inferencing](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/azure-ai-confidential-inferencing-preview/4248181). 
Together with [attested OHTTP client](https://github.com/microsoft/attested-ohttp-client) and a [transparent 
key management service](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-transparent-kms), it enables secure communication between clients and [Confidential GPU VMs](https://) serving Azure AI models using [chunked OHTTP](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ohai-chunked-ohttp-01.html). Learn more here.

## Build

The repo supports build and development using GitHub Codespaces and devcontainers. The repository includes a devcontainer configuration that installs all dependencies.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/attested-ohttp-server). 

Build the attested OHTTP server container.

```
make build-server-container
```

## Test

For local testing, this repository includes a sample whisper container. 

```
make build-whisper-container
```

Next, clone and build the attested OHTTP client container. 

```
git submodule update --recursive
make build-client-container
```

Finally, run the containers locally. This command will launch the OHTTP server in a mode where the server generates its own HPKE key pair, and publish an OHTTP key configuration at a local endpoint ```http://127.0.0.1:9443/discover```. This will also launch the whisper container, which listens at the endpoint ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/whisper```. 

```
make run-server-whisper
```

In a separate terminal, launch the client providing as input an audio file (included in this repo) and a OHTTP key configuration obtained from the discovery endpoint.
```
./scripts/service_wait.sh 127.0.0.1:3000
./scripts/service_wait.sh 127.0.0.1:9443
make run-client-container
```
